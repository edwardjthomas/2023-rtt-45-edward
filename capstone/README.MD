# Bufu Guild Commissions

Bufu Guild Commissions is my case study project for my rtt-45 course.

In short, it's a hypothetical website where you're able to purchase services from various creatives in:
* Art
* Music
* 2D Animation
* 3D Modeling
* Voice Over

# What can you do on it?

On the website, you're able to:
* Create a Authenticated User Account
* Login via Username & Password
* Search for which services you desire by service type
* Add your desired service to your cart
* Remove your desired service from your cart
* Checkout your services from your cart
* Review past purchases of your services

# How did I manage to do that?

~~long sleepless nights & crying~~

Through the use of Java, HTML, CSS, SpringBoot, Maven, Security, & Form Beans, this project managed to see the light of day. However, I had to make some compromises due to properly meeting requirements but overall I'm still pleased with its outcome.

Here are some of the pages you will frequently see:
